# Write a program that always asks the user to enter a number.
num = 0
sum1 =0
count = 0


while num !=-1:
          num = int(input("Insert a number(-1 exit question):"))# When the user enters the negative number -1, the program should stop requesting the user to enter a number,
          sum1 += num 
          count = count + 1
sum2 = sum1 + 1#plus the 1 of the -1 of exit
ave = count - 1#minus 1 from the count for the average
print(num)
print(sum2 / ave)# The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered excluding the -1.
