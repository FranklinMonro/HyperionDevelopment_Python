# One of the most important patterns in computers and on the internet is your password.
# For a password to be classified as ”Strong” the password needs to be structured in a certain way.
# Password Strength is determined by:
#   - The length of the password (at least 6 characters) (haveLength)
#   - Needs to contain uppercase letters (upCase)
#   - Needs to contain lowercase letters (lowCase)
#   - Needs to contain numbers (haveNum)
# Declare boolean variables for each one of these characteristics. 
# You will find the name of the variable next to the condition above, they must all be initialised as false.
haveLength = False
upCase = False
lowCase = False
haveNum = False
patternCheck = 0
passwordCheck = False
# Then ask the user a series of yes or no questions for each variable,and change the boolean variable to True or False based on their answer.
lengthCheck = input("Is your password longer than 6 characters?(Yes or No)").capitalize()
if lengthCheck == "Yes":
    haveLength = True

upCaseCheck = input("Does your password have at least one upper case character?(Yes or No)").capitalize()
if upCaseCheck == "Yes":
    upCase = True

lowCaseCheck = input("Does your password have at least one lower case character?(Yes or No)").capitalize()
if lowCaseCheck == "Yes":
    lowCase = True

haveNumCheck = input("Does your password have at least one number in?(Yes or No)").capitalize()
if haveNumCheck == "Yes":
    haveNum = True

if haveLength == True:
    patternCheck +=1

if upCase == True:
    patternCheck +=1

if lowCase == True:
    patternCheck +=1

if haveNum == True:
    patternCheck +=1
# Once 4 of the characteristics are met (4 of the variables == True) then display a message saying this is a suitable password.
